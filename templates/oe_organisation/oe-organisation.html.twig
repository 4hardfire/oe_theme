 * Default theme implementation to present a corporate content entity.
 *
 * Available variables:
 * - entity: The entity item, with limited access to object properties and
 *   methods. Only method names starting with "get", "has", or "is" and
 *   a few common methods such as "id", "label", and "bundle" are available.
 *   For example:
 *   - entity.getEntityTypeId() will return the entity type ID.
 *   - entity.hasField('field_example') returns TRUE if the entity includes
 *     field_example. (This does not indicate the presence of a value in this
 *     field.)
 *   Calling other methods, such as entity.delete(), will result in
 *   an exception.
 *   See \Drupal\Core\Entity\EntityInterface for a full list of methods.
 * - label: The entity label.
 * - content: The entity content.
 * - view_mode: View mode; for example, "teaser" or "full".
 * - logo: ImageValueObject.
 * - name: name value.
 * - oe_acronym: acronym value.
 * - oe_address: array with address field label and content.
 * - oe_website: array with website field label and content.
 * - oe_contact_url: array with url, icon and label of contact page url field.
